## Are random sentences computer generated?

No, the random sentences in our generator are not computer generated. We considered using computer generated sentences when building this tool, but found the results to be disappointing. Even though it took a lot of time, all the sentences in this generator were created by us.

## Can I use these random sentences for my project?

Yes! Feel free to use any of the random sentences for any project that you may be doing.

## Can I write random sentences?

Sure. We are always looking to expand the database of random sentences. If you have some random sentences that you've created yourself and you'd like to share them with others, fell free to send them to us for addition to this generator.

## What is a sentence?

In order to have a complete sentence, the sentence must have a minimum of three word types: a subject, a verb, and an object. In most cases, the subject is a noun or a pronoun. For example, the sentence "Jack loves candy" is a complete sentence because it has all three elements needed to make a complete sentence. Jack (the subject) loves (the verb) candy (the object).
